# MSWiAR
High-Performance Cross-Domain Recognition Framework using Multi-Source Domain Adaptation 
## Project Structure
This project contains two folders: `matlab` and `python`.  
The `python` folder is based on the [Paddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/) framework.
### matlab
Preprocessing of CSI Signals (Amplitude Extractionï¼ŒDenoising).
### python
 `RP_Convert.py` Transformation from Amplitude Sequence to 2D RP Images  
 `RP_Dataloader.py` Image Sample Loading  
 `MSWIAR.py` MSWiAR Model
 
## The Dataset Used in Experiments
You can download the public dataset from [WiDar3.0](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/widar3.0/).
The dataset processed using Recurrence Plots (RP) will also be uploaded soon.
